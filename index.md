# Dan Ragnar

* DevOps | Cloud Native | Infrastructure as Code *

## About

Jack of all trades, master of none engineer that have done most things in the field of DevOps/Systems Administration/Platform Engineering/SRE. I'm usually pragmatic and more interestedin actually solving problemse than the nitty gritty details of implementation. My strengths are a mix of social ability, seeing what the problem is and seeing other peoples problems in a non-dogmatic fashion.

I love solving problems, even if it's in your old legacy system that makes the most seasoned engineer cry. If it has a purpose, and solves real problems, I'm in.

## What I Do

- Finding out what the problem is, not throwing silver bullets at the problem
- DevOps == Solving problems as a team without prestige 
- Infrastructure as Code
- GitOps
- Platform engineering

## Tech Stack

Some technologies I work with:
- `GitLab`, `GitHub`, maybe even ye old `Jenkins` nightmare with `Groovy` splashed all around.
- `Kubernetes` (or `OpenShift`) cluster and platform building without creating a day-2 nightmare.
- `Terraform` and/or `Ansible`.
- `OpenStack`, `Azure`, `GCP` or `AWS` based infrastructure.
- `HashiCorp Vault` secrets management.
- `KeyCloak` and other `OIDC` based identity solutions, maybe even some light `Active Directory` work.
- Linux all around, containers (docker, podman, OCI, containerd). 
- `SBOM` generation & attestation, `Sigstore` and other Software supply chain security tools.
